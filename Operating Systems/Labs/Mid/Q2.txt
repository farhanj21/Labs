BEST METHOD: 2nd attempt
The use of n*n threads to perform the task as it will be faster and more efficent due to the use of parallel processing to execute multiplication.

SECOND: 3rd attempt
The use of 2 threads to perform the task is faster than 1 thread as two would work side by side doing each task simultaneously and then joined together.

WORST METHOD: 1st attempt
The use of a single thread to perform multiplcation would slowest as the CPU would process the whole matrix one by one in a sequence, hence being slower.


RANKING:
